Overview

We are planning to implement a recommendation system which will go through a dataset 
containing reviews from Amazon users about the products they have used. After analysing the dataset 
we plan to use the helpfulness, rating, product-id to find the best 5 and worst 5 products in that category.
We intend to do this to more than one category of products and find the same in all the categories.


Division of working

We will be using Hive with Dynamo for the purpose of storing and querying data.One of us will be working on the 
retrieval of data, setting up of environment and the other one will be responsible for insertion, querying and 
graphical representation of the results using existing API's.


Experiment

To validate the project we will have to get all the products with full score in helpfulness and rating and then see for the correctness manually.


Resources

We will be using Amazon services to store our data and query it using the Amazon infrastructure with help of Hive. We plan to use Amazon's IaaS service as hardware.
The datasets we plan to use are available online , we have already requested the authors of the data for their permission and in return they have asked us to quote them in the final paper.
